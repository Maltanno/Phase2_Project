Project for Flatiron School: Kings County Housing Data

## Members
Project members: TaeJoon Kim and Matthew Andrews

## Overview/Business Problem
A real estate firm needs a reliable model to predict house prices based on its features. With an accurate estimate, the firm can quickly identify underpriced houses to invest in and generate the maximum amount of profit upon resale.

## Preview of Results
- The variable with the highest effect on house prices was ‘waterfront.’
- Proximity to places like schools or government buildings had a notable impact on house prices as well.
- The model was not perfectly linear, due to high range of house prices that were included in the model.

## Data
Initial data contained data on 21,597 houses sold in Kings Country in 2014 and 2015.
